# TAMU FOODS
---
This is an e-Commerce food delivery web-based application that enables users to order food online from our partner range of restaurants and individual vendors.

A sequel alpha version of [TamuFoods](https://github.com/John-Kimani/tamu_foods_with_django.git) I made with Django and Postgres and beta version of [Tamu-Foods](https://github.com/John-Kimani/Tamu-Foods-BackEnd.git) that I had earlier made with the Flask framework during SD understudy.
